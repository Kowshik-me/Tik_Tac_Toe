# how to play
 By the way it is very easy to play.</br>
 Simply there is a need of two players to play this game.</br>
 The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares ie. you have total of 9 positions which will be displayed on the screen.</br>
 At first you  will choose the  position and place  the mark "O".</br>
 The opponent will choose the position accordingly and place it with the mark "X".</br>
 The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.</br>
 If there is no chance of getting three marks in a row but all the grids are filled then the game is condsidered as draw.</br>
